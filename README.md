AIT 670 George Mason University: Improving Cloud Security Posture With Azure Sentinel: A Real Time Threat Detection Solution

Folder Structure:

KQL Queries:

Contains Full List KQL Queries Used for all different Security use cases: Blocked Malicious IP Addresses, Blocking User Privileges, Infected Virtual Machine Logs, Blocking Non-
Legitimate Users, and Analysis of Multifactor Authentication and MSFT Entra ID Logs.

Note: .kql is not a valid file format for sharing KQL queries. Azure Sentinel queries are typically shared and stored in plain text files and KQL (Kusto Query Language) is primarily an Azure-specific language. It was developed by Microsoft for querying data in Azure Data Explorer (Kusto)

Data Files:

Full Extract of all Power BI Visualizations (PDF Format) used in Powerbi to work with visulization types

Full List of of CSV and Json Files Used to load the security log data into Azure Sentinel

PowerShell Scripts:

Full Script Used to Load data to Azure log analytics workspace which is later pushed to Azure Sentinel [Adjust JSON Data as needed]


Note: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format that uses key-value pairs to represent structured data while CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a text-based format where data is organized in rows and columns, used for the spreadsheets. Converting from CSV to JSON allows for easier data ingestion, parsing, and organization when loading into Microsoft Sentinel. This gives us efficient querying, monitoring, and alerting, making data analysis more effective within Azure Cloud Sentinel.
