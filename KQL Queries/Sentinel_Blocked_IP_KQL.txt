Below is KQL for Blocked IP's in Azure Sentinel: 
- This KQL query analyzes logs from a custom Azure Sentinel table gmu_blocked_ip_waf_CL to find IP addresses and threats blocked in the past 60 days with specific actions: "RootKit," "Ransomware," and "Keylogger." It projects relevant fields, counts the occurrences of each unique combination of resource, IP, and threat details, and orders the results by the highest block counts.
